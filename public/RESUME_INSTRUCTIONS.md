# Resume Placeholder

This is a placeholder for your resume. 

## To add your actual resume:

1. Save your resume as `resume.pdf`
2. Place it in the `/public` directory of your portfolio
3. The download will automatically work!

## Current Resume Links:
- FloatingDock (bottom control center) - Resume icon
- Command Menu (Ctrl+K / Cmd+K) - "View Resume" option

Both links point to `/resume.pdf` which will be served from the public directory.
